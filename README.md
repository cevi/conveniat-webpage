## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & Docker Compose
- An IDE that supports Devcontainers (e.g., [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Dev Containers
  extension, [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)).

## Getting Started

### Launch Project Locally (Devcontainer Recommended)

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill empty values.
3. Open the project using the provided devconatiner inside your IDE (VSCode or Webstorm are tested).
4. Start Developing using the following commands:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build --watch
   ```
   The above command launches a local development server with hot-reloading enabled.
   You can open the website on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Local Development Commands

- **Install Dependencies:** `pnpm install`
- **Start Development Server:** `docker compose up --build --watch`
- **Stop Development Server:** `docker compose down`
- **Clear Database & Volumes:** To completely reset the database and remove Docker volumes (useful for reseeding):
  ```bash
  docker compose down --volumes
  ```
  After running this, you'll need to restart the server with `docker compose up --build --watch` to re-initialize and
  potentially re-seed the database based on Payload's configuration.

### Accessing the Payload Admin Panel

Once the development server is running, you can typically access the Payload CMS admin interface at:
`http://localhost:3000/admin` (or your configured admin route)

## Project Structure

The project structure is influenced by Next.js App Router conventions and principles from Bulletproof React, emphasizing
modularity and maintainability.

```

### Feature-Based Modularity

- Most application logic resides within the `src/features` directory.
- Each sub-directory in `src/features` represents a distinct feature (e.g., `chat`, `map`, `payload-cms`).
- **Encapsulation:** Code within a feature folder should primarily relate to that specific feature.
- **Structure within Features:** A feature can internally have its own `components`, `hooks`, `api`, `types`, `utils`
  subdirectories, scoped to that feature.
- **Import Restrictions:** ESLint rules (`import/no-restricted-paths` in `eslint.config.mjs`) enforce unidirectional
  dependencies:
  - `app` can import from `features` and shared directories (`components`, `hooks`, etc.).
  - `features` _cannot_ import from `app` or shared directories.
  - Features generally should _not_ import directly from other features, promoting loose coupling. Exceptions are
    explicitly defined (e.g., `payload-cms` and `next-auth` can be imported more broadly).
  - Shared directories (`components`, `hooks`, `lib`, `types`, `utils`) should not import from `app` or `features`.
- **Payload CMS Exception:** The `payload-cms` feature is central and can be imported by other parts of the application
  as it defines the core data structures / content types used throughout the app.

This structure aids scalability, maintainability, and team collaboration by keeping concerns separated.

## Key Concepts

### Dynamic Page Rendering

A core aspect of this project is that most frontend pages are dynamically generated based on data managed within Payload
CMS.

1. **CMS Configuration (`src/features/payload-cms/payload.config.ts`, `src/features/payload-cms/settings`):** Defines
   data structures (Collections, Globals) and their fields. Collections might represent page types, blog posts, etc.
2. **Routing (`src/app/(frontend)/[locale]/(payload-pages)/[...slugs]/page.tsx`):** This dynamic route catches most
   frontend URL paths.
3. **Route Resolution:** The application resolves the incoming URL (`slugs`) against Collections and Globals defined in
   Payload CMS (via the `src/features/payload-cms/routeResolutionTable.ts`).
4. **Layout & Component Mapping:** Once the corresponding CMS data is found for a URL, a specific page layout (
   `src/features/payload-cms/page-layouts`) is rendered. Complex CMS fields (like Blocks or Rich Text) are mapped
   to React components using converters (`src/features/payload-cms/converters`).

### Progressive Web App (PWA)

This application utilizes [Serwist](https://serwist.pages.dev/) (`@serwist/next`) to implement Service Worker
functionality, enabling PWA features:

- **Offline Access:** Pre-cached pages (like the `/offline` page) and potentially other assets allow basic functionality
  when the user is offline.
- **Caching:** Improves performance by caching assets and network requests.
- **Reliability:** Provides a more resilient user experience on flaky networks.

The service worker logic is defined in `src/features/service-worker/index.ts` and configured in `next.config.mjs`. It's
generally disabled in development unless `ENABLE_SERVICE_WORKER_LOCALLY=true` is set.

## Code Quality & Conventions

Maintaining code quality and consistency is crucial.

### TypeScript Strictness

The project enforces strict TypeScript settings (`tsconfig.json`), including:
`strict`, `strictNullChecks`, `noImplicitAny`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, etc. This helps
catch errors at compile time and improves code reliability.

### Linting and Formatting

- **ESLint (`eslint.config.mjs`):** Used for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript/TypeScript code.
  Includes rules from `eslint:recommended`, `typescript-eslint`, `unicorn`, `react-hooks`, `next/core-web-vitals`, and
  custom rules for conventions and import restrictions.
- **Prettier:** Used for automatic code formatting to ensure a consistent style. Integrated via
  `eslint-plugin-prettier`.
- **Run Checks:** (Ensure these scripts exist in your `package.json`)
  ```bash
  # Run ESLint checks and fix issues
  pnpm run lint
  ```

### Import Restrictions

As mentioned in the [Project Structure](#project-structure) section, ESLint rules strictly enforce module boundaries to
maintain a clean and understandable architecture. Path aliases (`@/*`, `@payload-config`) defined in `tsconfig.json` are
used for cleaner imports.

## UI Component Library

- **[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/):** Provides beautifully designed, accessible components built on Radix UI and
  Tailwind CSS. Components are typically copied into the project (`src/components/ui`) rather than installed as a
  dependency.
- **[Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/):** Used for unstyled, accessible UI components providing underlying logic for
  elements like modals, dropdowns, etc.
- **[Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/):** Provides a wide range of clean and consistent SVG icons.

## Environment Variables

- Configuration is managed via environment variables.
- `.env.example` serves as a template listing the required variables.
- Create a `.env` file (copied from `.env.example`) for local development. **Never commit `.env` files to Git.**
- Populate `.env` with necessary credentials (database URLs, API keys, secrets, etc.).

## Build Production Bundle

The easiest way to build the page into a production ready bundle is to use the provided Docker Compose file.
This will build the Next.js application and Payload CMS, and prepare it for deployment.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build
```

However, you can also build the application manually using the following commands.
Please ensure that you have deleted `node_modules`, `src/lib/prisma/*`, and `.next`
before running the commands to ensure a clean build.

Also make sure that you DON'T have any `.env` file in the root of the project, as this will
cause issues with the build process.

```bash
# Export environment variables
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | grep '^NEXT_PUBLIC_' | xargs)
export BUILD_TARGET="production"
export NODE_ENV="production"
export DISABLE_SERVICE_WORKER="true" # speeds up build process (optional)
export PRISMA_OUTPUT="src/lib/prisma/client/"

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Create build info file
bash create_build_info.sh

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Build the Next.js application
pnpm next build
```

### Analyse Bundle Size

To analyze the bundle size of the Next.js application, you can use the `next-bundle-analyzer` package.
Xou can run the following command to analyze the bundle size. This will generate a report and open it in
your default browser.

```bash
ANALYZE=true pnpm build
```
