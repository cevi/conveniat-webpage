/**
 * This controls how long an optimized image is cached inside the next/image cache. Normally,
 * we should keep this value low, as there is no direct way to invalidate the cache.
 *
 * However, since we use the payload api to request our original images, and we rename the
 * original images on every change to the image object, we can safely set this to a high value.
 *
 * After 90 days, we revalidate the next/image cache.
 *
 * It is important that the images get cached longer than any potential cache of an HTML page that
 * references the image, such that the image is always available when the page is requested.
 *
 * Note: this has no effect for the local development server.
